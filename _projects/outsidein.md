360-degree video contains a full field of environmental content. However, browsing these videos, either on screens or through head-mounted displays (HMDs), users consume only a subset of the full field of view per a natural viewing experience. This causes a search problem when a region-of-interest (ROI) in a video is outside of the current field of view (FOV) on the screen, or users may search for non-existing ROIs.

We propose Outside-In, a visualization technique which re-introduces off-screen regions-of-interest (ROIs) into the main screen as spatial picture-in-picture (PIP) previews. The geometry of the preview windows further encodes a ROI's relative location vis-à-vis the main screen view, allowing for effective navigation.

 I participated in the discussion of main idea and implemented several interactive visualization of 360 videos. I also implemented the a live telepresence application.
