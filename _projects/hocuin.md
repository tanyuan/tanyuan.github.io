“Hot! Cute! Interaction! (HoCuIn / ほきゅいん)” is a 7-day workshop aiming at introducing HCI to graduate students in Taiwan. After courses including HCI theories, technologies, research methods and design-related skills, the students are going to develop their own projects in groups and make an exhibition on the final day. We hope to boost innovative ideas and interesting projects throughout this process.

The first “Hot! Cute! Interaction! (HoCuIn’17)” will be held from July 16th to July 22th in National Taiwan University. The topic of this year is “Design your Third Hand”, which relates to novel interaction between human and robot arm.
