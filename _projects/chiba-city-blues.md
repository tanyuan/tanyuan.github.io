作品名稱取自於 William Gibson 的科幻小說《神經喚術士》(_Neuromancer_, 1984)的第一章章名，我們從開頭的仁清街酒吧，作為故事場景。我們設想了生化人的角色，作為服務型的機器人，其情緒受到限制，無法感受喜怒哀樂。然而突然出現神秘的調酒，這種調酒充滿情緒，若非人類，是無法調出的。就像是有名的餐館背後都有神秘的故事一般。

The story is named after the first chapter of the novel _Neuromancer_ by William Gibson in 1984. Cyborg bartenders were restricted for having perception of emotions; however, there was a rumor that a mysterious cocktail appeared from a bar in Cyborg Zone that could stimulate human emotions. It was deeply believed that only humans could made this. We created several props for the story to engage viewers to imagine being there in the fiction.

我們設計街頭尋人啟事公告、酒吧的視覺圖像：招牌、酒單。想像充滿喜怒哀樂的奇幻調酒的顏色與結構：

We designed the poster, and cocktails that stimulate multiple kinds of emotions:

製作了酒吧裡的終端機台，為生化人駭入網際空間的外神經裝置：

We made props of the headset and gloves for accessing the cyberspace:
