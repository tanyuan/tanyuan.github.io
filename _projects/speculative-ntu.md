自人類第一次拿起石器，兩百五十萬年間，人類的價值與工具內外交融，成為目前所熟知的型態。然而，對於「價值」的諸多質疑已使得現今秩序崩壞。面對未來，我們還能不能有所期待？

本次《形》策展以此作為起點，想像人性與科技的三種走向 — 退化 、 平衡 、 超越 。劃分台大校園為三個極端的虛構聚落，作為科技變形的實驗場。退化的〈懼形〉中，科技成了世界的支配者，人類淪落為次等物種；平衡的〈制形〉中，社會運作受到演算法監控，追求最佳化的理想；超越的〈探形〉中，藉由科技擴增感官，分化出新的認知方式。《形》策展帶領觀者經歷三個價值場域，放下原有的信念，形塑另類的科技理想。

I participated in the student tech art exhibition curation at the annual Art Festival of National Taiwan University. People in Taiwan constantly struggle with their cultural identity. Inspired by Dunne and Raby's speculative exhibition [United Micro Kingdom](http://www.unitedmicrokingdoms.org/), we decided the exhibition theme not to be about how technology changes the society, but about how people holding different values and belief would transform technology in the far future.

We recruited students from different departments and held brainstormings. Three main themes came out: A world where humans become inferior to machines, a world where humans and data strike an optimal balance and a world where humans extend their body and knowledge to become transhumans. Through these three worlds, 80 students got involved and the artworks, including several interactive installations, were exhibited in different places in the campus.

## VR Exhibition

I created this virtual reality (VR) experience using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) with 360 photos captured during the exhibition throughout four places in the campus (one for the exhibition portal and three worlds).
