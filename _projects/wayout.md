Thanks to motion sensors embedded in smartphones, we are able to navigate an omnidirectional panorama by moving the device around the body, as if the display is a peephole to another world. However, existing applications mainly focus on the spherical surface around the user with a constant radius, i.e., single-layer navigation. We present Way Out, a game allowing players to navigate multi-layer panorama scenes by around-body interactions. Way Out explores the interaction possibilities of reaching out into panorama with depth. By utilizing the front-facing camera, the system tracks the player’s face and infers the distance between the user and the device based on the size of the face, thus enabling depth interactions. In this game, the player can walk through a panoramic forest maze that consists of four layers in depth and drag items in physical 3D space.
