Thanks to motion sensors embedded in smartphones, we are able to navigate an omnidirectional panorama by moving the device around the body, as if the display is a peephole to another world. However, existing applications mainly focus on the spherical surface around the user with a constant radius, i.e., single-layer navigation. We present Way Out, a game allowing players to navigate multi-layer panorama scenes by around-body interactions. Way Out explores the interaction possibilities of reaching out into panorama with depth. By utilizing the front-facing camera, the system tracks the playerâ€™s face and infers the distance between the user and the device based on the size of the face, thus enabling depth interactions. In this game, the player can walk through a panoramic forest maze that consists of four layers in depth and drag items in physical 3D space.
