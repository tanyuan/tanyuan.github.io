Playing air guitar is an enjoyable way to feel the music; however, it takes some skills to be capable of. We propose “EMS Air Guitar,” an air guitar assistant using electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), which impulses the user’s arm to generate the strumming motion on the right time. We found that EMS can be an effective tool to make the air guitar easier to learn and play.
