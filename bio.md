<span class="note">Taipei, Taiwan</span>

I am a Master's student and Human-Computer Interaction researcher in Communications and Multimedia Lab at National Taiwan University.

I like to experiment new ways of physical interaction with virtual world, such as using [spatial sensors](/projects/wayout), [robotic arms](/projects/stylus) and [electrical muscle stimulation](/projects/emsairguitar). I believe interfaces that integrate digital information with body movement and haptic sensation would bring us total harmony between human and technology.

I am also interested in new media art. I curated [a tech art exhibtion](/projects/speculative-ntu) based on speculative design in campus.
