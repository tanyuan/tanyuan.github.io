<span class="note">Taipei, Taiwan</span>

He is a human-computer interaction researcher focusing on novel interfaces. He likes to experiment new ways of physical interactions with the virtual world, such as using [spatial sensors](/projects/wayout), [robotic arms](/projects/stylus),  [electrical muscle stimulation](/projects/emsairguitar) and [pneumatic actuation](/projects/pupop). He believes interfaces that integrate digital information with body movement and haptic sensation will bring us total harmony between humans and technology.
