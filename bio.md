## Shan-Yuan Teng | 鄧善元

He is a human-computer interaction researcher focusing on novel interfaces. He likes to experiment new ways of physical interaction with virtual world, such as using [spatial sensors](/projects/wayout), [robotic arms](/projects/stylus),  [electrical muscle stimulation](/projects/emsairguitar) and pneumatic actuation. He believes interfaces that integrate digital information with body movement and haptic sensation would bring us total harmony between human and technology.
