Shan-Yuan is a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researcher who explores future interactions by inventing novel hardware. He will soon become a Computer Science PhD student in [Pedro Lopes'](http://plopes.org) lab at the University of Chicago. He believes that seamless integration of haptic sensation and digital information will bring us total harmony between humans and technologies. He has been experimenting with [wearable airbags](/projects/pupop), [robotic arms on tablets](/projects/stylus), and [electrical muscle stimulation](/projects/emsairguitar).
