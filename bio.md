My name is Shan-Yuan Teng (鄧善元). I am a Master's student working on Human-Computer Interaction in Communications & Multimedia Lab at National Taiwan University.

I like to experiment new ways of physical interaction with virtual world, such as using *spatial sensors*, *robotic arms* and *electrical muscle stimulation*. I believe interfaces that integrate digital information with body movement and haptic sensation would bring us total harmony between human and technology.
